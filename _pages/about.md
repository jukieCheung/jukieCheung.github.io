I'm an incoming PhD student from [Department of ECE](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/ece/), [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/). My research interest includes 3D vision, medical imaging, machine learning, and human-centred AI.

I would be very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Greta Mok](https://big.fst.um.edu.mo/people/pi/) of [BIG Lab](https://big.fst.um.edu.mo/), University of Macau. I was advised by [Ir. Dr. Aaron Leung](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/bme/people/_delete_academic-staff-old/leung_kam_lun_aaron/) from [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/).
